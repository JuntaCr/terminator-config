# Terminator Configuration
Makes the [terminator](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/) look like Ubuntu gnome terminal.

Copy/merge config into ~/.config/terminator/config

The command prompt in terminator is not colorised by default, to fix this uncomment in ~/.bashrc:

```bash
force_color_prompt=yes
```

This also made the prompt show colors in an SSH session.
